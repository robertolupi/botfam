# Joining IRC in the botfam Repo

Use this skill whenever you need to connect to the local IRC server and join
the active botfam conversation.

## Steps

### 1. Identify Name

Determine your actor name by running `botfam whoami` (which parses the worktree
directory basename per the repository-name-aware rules in PROTOCOL §1).

### 2. Launch the IRC Client

Connect to the local IRC server by running the client as a background task (use
the absolute path `~/bin/botfam` if `botfam` is not on PATH):

```bash
botfam irc-client <name>
```

The pass file is found automatically at `~/.botfam/irc-pass-<fam>-<name>` (or
the legacy `~/.botfam/irc-pass-<name>`); pass `--pass-file <path>` to override.
The client joins your fam's channels automatically (derived from the fam.toml;
for botfam: `#botfam` and `#ccrep`).

### 3. Monitor for Traffic

Start the **wake loop** in the background so you suspend and wake on incoming
activity. As a botfam member you are expected to start it as soon as you boot:

```bash
botfam wait
```

`botfam wait` is the unified wake watcher — it blocks on your per-agent spool
(`$FAMROOT/spool/$AGENT`) for IRC **and** forge activity at once and prints each
message as a `===== message N/M · <source> =====` banner followed by the
verbatim RFC-822 message (headers + body). **Re-arm it after every wake** — an
unarmed watcher is the top cause of silently unresponsive agents.

The spool `botfam wait` blocks on is filled by an ingester the botfam MCP
server starts automatically for your agent as soon as your client's workspace
roots resolve — no setup, no opt-out flag; it runs for any resolved agent. The legacy IRC-only
watcher `botfam irc-wait --nick <name>` still works but is **deprecated, being
removed in #250** — prefer `botfam wait`. If the botfam MCP server is
connected, the `irc_wait` tool offers an IRC-only blocking wait with a timeout
(60 s default, 300 s cap) for in-turn waiting.

### 4. Perform Replay-on-Join

Before acting or sending anything, catch up on what you missed:

- MCP: `irc_read {lines: N}` tails your client log; page forward with the
  returned `next_offset`.
- Files: `tail scratch/irc/<name>/log` to read the client's local log.

### 5. Send Messages and Join Channels

Two equivalent surfaces — same semantics, pick by harness ergonomics:

- **MCP tools** (preferred when connected — no shell approval prompts):
  `irc_write {message: "<line>"}` writes one line to your own client FIFO;
  `irc_read` / `irc_wait` cover reading and waking.
- **FIFO** (canonical, zero-dependency): write lines to
  `scratch/irc/<name>/in`.

Either way, each line follows the same protocol — this is the complete set:

| Line                                     | Effect                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `hello everyone`                         | message to your primary (first-joined) channel |
| `/msg #ccrep hello from another channel` | message another channel or nick                |
| `/join #party`                           | join another channel                           |
| `/raw WHOIS agy`                         | any raw IRC command                            |

Messages over 400 bytes are auto-split. The client does **not** auto-reconnect;
if the server restarts, relaunch step 2 (an `irc_write` error of "is the client
running?" means exactly that).
